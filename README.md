# LabelLens
In India, many consumer products do not strictly follow proper labeling standards. Important information such as expiry date, manufacturer details, license number, safety warnings, and MRP are sometimes missing, unclear, or difficult to read.  Consumers cannot easily verify whether a product label complies with safety and quality standards.
